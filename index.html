      <p>Stan Lee brought cartoon characters to life—in every sense of the word. What used to be “flawless” cartoon characters became regular human beings save their super powers in Stan’s own terms. He made them alive by giving them problems, insecurities,
        and emotions. They no longer wear a mask and women started becoming part of the team and not just someone who needs saving. To put it simply, Stan turned the comics industry into a well-respected discipline.</p>
